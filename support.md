## About CribVision

CribVision is a cribbage scoring aid that uses your iPhone's camera to detect playing cards and automatically calculate your hand score. Point your camera at your four hand cards and the cut card, and the app identifies each card, determines the score, and shows a complete breakdown of fifteens, pairs, runs, flushes, and nobs.

## Getting Started

1. **Place your cards on a flat surface.** Arrange your four hand cards loosely fanned so the rank and suit of each card are clearly visible. Place the cut card separately from the hand — above, below, or to the side with a visible gap.

2. **Point your camera at the cards.** All five cards must be within the camera's frame. Hold your phone roughly 6–12 inches above the cards. The app works best with even lighting and minimal glare.

3. **Wait for detection.** A progress bar shows how many cards have been identified. Cards appear as badges on screen as they lock in. Detection typically takes 1–3 seconds.

4. **Confirm the cut card.** The app will attempt to identify which card is the cut card based on its position. If it guesses wrong or isn't sure, simply tap the correct card.

5. **Review your score.** The total score is displayed on the scan result screen. Tap it to see the full scoring breakdown with every point-earning combination.

6. **Save or discard.** If the detection was correct, tap the checkmark to save the hand to your history. If any card was wrong, tap the X to discard it and rescan.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Fan your cards loosely** so the rank and suit in the top-left corner of each card are clearly visible and not overlapped by other cards.
- **Separate the cut card** from the hand cards with a visible gap. The wider the separation, the more reliably the app identifies it automatically.
- **Use good lighting.** Avoid harsh glare or deep shadows on the cards. Indoor lighting works well; direct sunlight can cause reflections that interfere with detection.
- **Hold steady.** Keep your phone relatively still while the app is detecting. The app needs several consistent frames to lock in each card.
- **If detection stalls,** the app will suggest fanning your cards wider. Spreading the cards so more of each card face is visible significantly improves accuracy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How accurate is the detection?**
The app correctly identifies most cards when they are clearly visible. Accuracy decreases when cards are tightly overlapped and only the corner index is showing. For best results, fan your cards so each card's rank and suit are fully visible.

**Q: Can I use this during a game?**
Yes. CribVision is designed as a scoring aid for casual play. Point your camera at your hand after it's been played, confirm the result, and move on.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
Card detection and scoring work entirely offline — no internet connection is required. An internet connection is only needed to display advertisements and process in-app purchases.

**Q: How do I remove ads?**
Go to Settings (gear icon) and tap "Remove Ads." This is a one-time purchase of $2.99. If you've already purchased on another device, tap "Restore Purchases."

**Q: What devices are supported?**
CribVision requires an iPhone running iOS 17.6 or later with a camera. The app is not available on iPad at this time.

**Q: Does the app store my data?**
Hand history is stored locally on your device only. No data is transmitted to any server. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

**Cards not detecting:** Ensure the camera has a clear view of all five cards with no significant overlap on the corner indices. Try increasing the distance between cards. Check that your camera lens is clean.

**Wrong card detected:** The app may confuse visually similar cards (such as Ace and 4, or 5 and 3) when only the corner is visible. Fan your cards wider and rescan. You can discard incorrect scans without saving them.

**Cut card wrong:** Tap the correct card in the card strip on the scan result screen. The app re-scores automatically when you select a different cut card.

**App crashes or freezes:** Force-close the app and reopen it. If the issue persists, please contact support with your device model and iOS version.
