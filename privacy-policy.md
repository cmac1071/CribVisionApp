# Privacy Policy for CribVision

**Effective date: February 26, 2026**

CribVision ("the App") is developed by Chris MacLellan. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Camera Access

The App uses your device's camera solely to detect playing cards in real time. Camera frames are processed entirely on your device using Apple's Core ML framework. No images or video are stored, transmitted, or shared. Camera data never leaves your device.

## Data Storage

Hand history (detected cards and scores) is stored locally on your device only. This data is never transmitted to the developer, any server, or any third party. Deleting the App removes all stored data.

## Third-Party Advertising

The App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google may collect and use data in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). You may opt out of personalized advertising through your device's privacy settings (Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking). A one-time in-app purchase is available to remove all advertisements.

## In-App Purchases

Purchase transactions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. The developer does not receive or store any payment information.

## Analytics and Tracking

The App does not use any first-party analytics, crash reporting, or tracking services. The App does not collect device identifiers, usage data, or location information.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates to this privacy policy will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
